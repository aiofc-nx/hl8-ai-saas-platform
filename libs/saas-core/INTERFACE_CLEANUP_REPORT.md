# Interface Layer Cleanup Report

**Date**: 2024-12-19  
**Module**: libs/saas-core/src/interface  
**Action**: Cleanup Interface Layer

## Summary

Removed 12 directories that violated Clean Architecture boundaries by containing code that belongs in other layers (Application, Domain, Infrastructure).

## Directories Removed

### Application Layer Code (5 directories)

- `commands/` - Command objects belong in Application layer
- `queries/` - Query objects belong in Application layer
- `handlers/` - Command/Query handlers belong in Application layer
- `use-cases/` - Use cases belong in Application layer
- `services/` - Application services belong in Application layer

### Domain Layer Code (5 directories)

- `entities/` - Entities belong in Domain layer
- `aggregates/` - Aggregates belong in Domain layer
- `value-objects/` - Value objects belong in Domain layer
- `events/` - Domain events belong in Domain layer
- `abilities/` - CASL abilities belong in Domain layer

### Infrastructure Layer Code (2 directories)

- `repositories/` - Repository implementations belong in Infrastructure layer
- `persistence/` - Persistence logic belongs in Infrastructure layer

## Directories Retained

### Valid Interface Layer Components

- `controllers/` - REST API controllers
- `dto/` - Data Transfer Objects (Request/Response DTOs)
- `guards/` - Authentication and Authorization guards

## Actions Taken

1. **Deleted 12 directories** that violated architectural boundaries
2. **Updated index.ts** to export guards
3. **Verified clean separation** of concerns

## Result

The interface layer now contains only interface-specific code:

- API controllers
- Request/Response DTOs
- Guards for authentication and authorization

This aligns with Clean Architecture principles and prepares for integration with `libs/interface-kernel`.

## Next Steps

1. Align controllers with `RestController` from `@hl8/interface-kernel`
2. Integrate `InterfaceKernelModule` services
3. Align guards with base guards from `@hl8/interface-kernel`
4. Use shared decorators from `@hl8/interface-kernel`
