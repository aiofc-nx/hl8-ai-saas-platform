# Tasks: Exception System Enhancement

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-exception-system-enhancement/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Library project**: `libs/exceptions/src/` at repository root, unit tests in same directory as source
- **Test Organization**: Unit tests co-located with source, integration tests in `test/integration/`, E2E tests in `test/e2e/`

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create exception category directory structure in libs/exceptions/src/core/
- [x] T002 Create layer-specific directory structure in libs/exceptions/src/core/layers/
- [x] T003 [P] Update libs/exceptions/package.json with enhanced dependencies
- [x] T004 [P] Update libs/exceptions/tsconfig.json for new structure
- [x] T005 [P] Update libs/exceptions/eslint.config.mjs for new files
- [x] T006 [P] Update libs/exceptions/jest.config.ts for new test structure

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T007 Create layer-specific base exception classes in libs/exceptions/src/core/layers/
- [x] T008 [P] Create exception category base classes in libs/exceptions/src/core/
- [x] T009 [P] Update AbstractHttpException to support new categorization in libs/exceptions/src/core/abstract-http.exception.ts
- [x] T010 [P] Enhance ExceptionMessageProvider interface in libs/exceptions/src/providers/exception-message.provider.ts
- [x] T011 [P] Update DefaultMessageProvider for new exception types in libs/exceptions/src/providers/default-message.provider.ts
- [x] T012 Update exception module configuration in libs/exceptions/src/exception.module.ts
- [x] T013 [P] Update index.ts exports for new structure in libs/exceptions/src/index.ts

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Standardized Error Handling (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Implement core authentication, user management, and tenant isolation exceptions with RFC7807 compliance

- [x] T026 [P] [US1] Create InvalidTenantContextException in libs/exceptions/src/core/tenant/invalid-tenant-context.exception.ts
- [x] T027 [US1] Create auth category index file in libs/exceptions/src/core/auth/index.ts

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Categorized Exception Management (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Implement validation, business rule, and system resource exceptions with proper categorization

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that exceptions are properly organized into categories (auth, user, tenant, validation, system, etc.) and that each category contains all necessary exception types for that domain.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T032 [P] [US2] Create BusinessRuleViolationException in libs/exceptions/src/core/validation/business-rule-violation.exception.ts

- [x] T046 [US2] Update core index file to export new categories in libs/exceptions/src/core/index.ts

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Architecture Layer Exception Mapping (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Implement layer-specific exception base classes and exception mapping configuration

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by implementing exceptions for each architectural layer and verifying that domain exceptions don't leak infrastructure details, and that exceptions are properly transformed as they move between layers.

- [x] T058 [US3] Update core index file to export new categories in libs/exceptions/src/core/index.ts

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [x] T055 [P] Update README.md with new exception categories and usage examples in libs/exceptions/README.md
- [ ] T056 [P] Create comprehensive unit tests for all new exception classes in libs/exceptions/src/core/*/

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all auth exceptions for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create AuthenticationFailedException in libs/exceptions/src/core/auth/authentication-failed.exception.ts"
Task: "Create UnauthorizedException in libs/exceptions/src/core/auth/unauthorized.exception.ts"
Task: "Create TokenExpiredException in libs/exceptions/src/core/auth/token-expired.exception.ts"
Task: "Create InvalidTokenException in libs/exceptions/src/core/auth/invalid-token.exception.ts"
Task: "Create InsufficientPermissionsException in libs/exceptions/src/core/auth/insufficient-permissions.exception.ts"

# Launch all user exceptions for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create UserNotFoundException in libs/exceptions/src/core/user/user-not-found.exception.ts"
Task: "Create UserAlreadyExistsException in libs/exceptions/src/core/user/user-already-exists.exception.ts"
Task: "Create InvalidUserStatusException in libs/exceptions/src/core/user/invalid-user-status.exception.ts"
Task: "Create UserAccountLockedException in libs/exceptions/src/core/user/user-account-locked.exception.ts"
Task: "Create UserAccountDisabledException in libs/exceptions/src/core/user/user-account-disabled.exception.ts"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
