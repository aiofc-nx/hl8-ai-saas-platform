# Feature Specification: Exception System Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `004-exception-system-enhancement`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "根据libs/exceptions/docs创建技术规范"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Standardized Error Handling (Priority: P1)

Developers need a comprehensive exception handling system that provides standardized error responses across all business scenarios in the SAAS platform, ensuring consistent user experience and efficient error diagnosis.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation for all error handling in the platform. Without standardized exceptions, error responses will be inconsistent, making debugging difficult and user experience poor.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by implementing authentication, user management, and tenant isolation exceptions and verifying that all error responses follow RFC7807 standard with consistent format and appropriate HTTP status codes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer is implementing user authentication, **When** authentication fails, **Then** the system returns a standardized AuthenticationFailedException with RFC7807 format, proper HTTP status code (401), and detailed error information
2. **Given** a developer is implementing user management, **When** a user is not found, **Then** the system returns a standardized UserNotFoundException with RFC7807 format, proper HTTP status code (404), and contextual data
3. **Given** a developer is implementing multi-tenant features, **When** cross-tenant access is attempted, **Then** the system returns a standardized CrossTenantAccessException with RFC7807 format, proper HTTP status code (403), and violation details

### User Story 2 - Categorized Exception Management (Priority: P2)

Developers need exceptions organized by business domain (authentication, user management, tenant management, etc.) to easily find and use appropriate exception types for their specific use cases.

**Why this priority**: Categorized exceptions improve developer productivity and code maintainability by providing clear organization and reducing the time needed to find the right exception type.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that exceptions are properly organized into categories (auth, user, tenant, validation, system, etc.) and that each category contains all necessary exception types for that domain.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer needs authentication-related exceptions, **When** they look in the auth category, **Then** they find AuthenticationFailedException, UnauthorizedException, TokenExpiredException, InvalidTokenException, and InsufficientPermissionsException
2. **Given** a developer needs user management exceptions, **When** they look in the user category, **Then** they find UserNotFoundException, UserAlreadyExistsException, InvalidUserStatusException, UserAccountLockedException, and UserAccountDisabledException
3. **Given** a developer needs validation exceptions, **When** they look in the validation category, **Then** they find ValidationFailedException, BusinessRuleViolationException, and ConstraintViolationException

---

### User Story 3 - Architecture Layer Exception Mapping (Priority: P3)

Developers need exceptions that align with the Clean Architecture layers (Interface, Application, Domain, Infrastructure) to maintain proper separation of concerns and architectural integrity.

**Why this priority**: Layer-specific exceptions ensure that errors are handled at the appropriate architectural level and maintain the integrity of the Clean Architecture pattern.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by implementing exceptions for each architectural layer and verifying that domain exceptions don't leak infrastructure details, and that exceptions are properly transformed as they move between layers.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a domain layer exception occurs, **When** it propagates to the application layer, **Then** it is properly wrapped in an application layer exception without exposing domain implementation details
2. **Given** an infrastructure layer exception occurs, **When** it propagates to the application layer, **Then** it is transformed into a business-meaningful exception that doesn't expose infrastructure details
3. **Given** an interface layer receives an exception, **When** it processes the exception, **Then** it returns an appropriate HTTP response with proper status code and user-friendly message

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an unknown exception type is thrown that doesn't fit any existing category?
- How does the system handle exceptions with missing or invalid error codes?
- What happens when exception data contains sensitive information that shouldn't be exposed to clients?
- How does the system handle exceptions in different environments (development, staging, production) with varying detail levels?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide standardized exception classes for all major business domains (authentication, user management, tenant management, validation, system resources)
- **FR-002**: System MUST organize exceptions into clear categories following naming conventions (DomainException format with appropriate prefixes)
- **FR-003**: System MUST support RFC7807 standard error response format for all exceptions
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide appropriate HTTP status codes for each exception type (401 for auth failures, 404 for not found, 403 for unauthorized, etc.)
- **FR-005**: System MUST include contextual data in exceptions without exposing sensitive information
- **FR-006**: System MUST support internationalization through configurable message providers
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide layer-specific exception base classes aligned with Clean Architecture
- **FR-008**: System MUST include comprehensive logging for all exceptions with appropriate detail levels
- **FR-009**: System MUST support exception inheritance hierarchy for code reusability and consistency
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide validation and testing utilities for exception classes

### Key Entities

- **Exception Category**: Represents a business domain grouping (auth, user, tenant, validation, system) with standardized naming conventions and error code prefixes
- **Exception Class**: Represents a specific exception type with error code, HTTP status, title, detail message, and optional contextual data
- **Exception Hierarchy**: Represents the inheritance structure from AbstractHttpException through domain-specific base classes to concrete exception implementations
- **Message Provider**: Represents the interface for providing localized exception messages with parameter substitution capabilities

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: System provides 25+ standardized exception classes covering all major business scenarios (authentication, user management, tenant management, validation, system resources)
- **SC-002**: Exception response format compliance with RFC7807 standard achieves 100% consistency across all exception types
- **SC-003**: Developers can find and implement appropriate exceptions for any business scenario within 30 seconds
- **SC-004**: Exception handling reduces debugging time by 60% through standardized error codes and contextual information
- **SC-005**: System supports 10+ exception categories with clear organization and naming conventions
- **SC-006**: Exception inheritance hierarchy enables 90% code reuse across related exception types
- **SC-007**: Internationalization support allows exception messages to be provided in multiple languages with parameter substitution
- **SC-008**: Architecture layer mapping ensures 100% of exceptions are properly categorized by architectural layer (Interface, Application, Domain, Infrastructure)
