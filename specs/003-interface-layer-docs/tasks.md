# Tasks: Interface Layer Documentation

**Feature**: Interface Layer Documentation  
**Branch**: `003-interface-layer-docs`  
**Date**: 2024-12-19  
**Purpose**: Actionable tasks for implementing comprehensive interface layer documentation

## Summary

Create comprehensive documentation for the interface layer including technical architecture, implementation guides, and visual diagrams to serve multiple audiences (architects, developers, stakeholders) with appropriate detail levels and production-ready considerations.

## Dependencies

### User Story Completion Order

1. **US1 (P1)**: Technical Architecture Documentation - Foundation for all other work
2. **US2 (P2)**: Implementation Guidance - Depends on US1 for architectural context
3. **US3 (P3)**: Visual Architecture Understanding - Can be developed in parallel with US2

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

- **US2 and US3**: Can be developed in parallel after US1 completion
- **Documentation Index**: Can be updated incrementally as each document is completed
- **Cross-references**: Can be added as documents are finalized

- [ ] T033 [US2] Update Documentation Index with Implementation Guide references

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Visual Architecture Understanding (P3)

### Story Goal

Stakeholders, project managers, and new team members need visual representations of the interface layer architecture to understand system relationships, data flow, and component interactions.

### Independent Test Criteria

Can be fully tested by having a non-technical stakeholder review the architecture diagrams and successfully understand the system structure and data flow.

### Implementation Tasks
