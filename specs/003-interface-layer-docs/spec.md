# Feature Specification: Interface Layer Documentation

**Feature Branch**: `003-interface-layer-docs`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "docs/INTERFACE_LAYER_TECHNICAL_PLAN.md、docs/INTERFACE_LAYER_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md、docs/INTERFACE_LAYER_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Technical Architecture Documentation (Priority: P1)

Architects and technical leads need comprehensive documentation that explains the interface layer's technical architecture, design decisions, and integration patterns to make informed decisions about system design and implementation.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation for all other interface layer work - without clear architectural documentation, teams cannot effectively plan, implement, or maintain the interface layer.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having a technical architect review the documentation and successfully understand the system architecture, make design decisions, and communicate the approach to development teams.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a technical architect needs to understand the interface layer, **When** they read the technical plan documentation, **Then** they can understand the architecture, technology choices, and design rationale
2. **Given** a development team needs to implement the interface layer, **When** they reference the technical documentation, **Then** they can understand the required components and integration patterns

---

### User Story 2 - Implementation Guidance (Priority: P2)

Developers need detailed implementation guides with code examples, configuration instructions, and step-by-step procedures to successfully build the interface layer components.

**Why this priority**: While architecture provides the "what" and "why", implementation guides provide the "how" - essential for actual development work.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having a developer follow the implementation guide and successfully create a working interface layer prototype or component.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer needs to implement a REST API controller, **When** they follow the implementation guide, **Then** they can create a working controller with proper authentication, validation, and error handling
2. **Given** a developer needs to set up GraphQL resolvers, **When** they follow the implementation guide, **Then** they can create functional resolvers with proper data fetching and real-time subscriptions

---

### User Story 3 - Visual Architecture Understanding (Priority: P3)

Stakeholders, project managers, and new team members need visual representations of the interface layer architecture to understand system relationships, data flow, and component interactions.

**Why this priority**: Visual documentation helps non-technical stakeholders understand the system and enables faster onboarding of new team members.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having a non-technical stakeholder review the architecture diagrams and successfully understand the system structure and data flow.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a project manager needs to understand the interface layer scope, **When** they review the architecture diagrams, **Then** they can understand the components, relationships, and integration points
2. **Given** a new team member needs to understand the system, **When** they study the visual documentation, **Then** they can understand the overall architecture and component responsibilities

### Edge Cases

- What happens when documentation becomes outdated due to system changes?
- How does the system handle different skill levels of developers using the documentation?
- What if the documentation needs to be translated to different languages?
- How does the system handle version control of documentation alongside code changes?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Documentation MUST provide comprehensive technical architecture overview including technology stack, design patterns, and integration strategies
- **FR-002**: Documentation MUST include detailed implementation guides with code examples, configuration instructions, and step-by-step procedures
- **FR-003**: Documentation MUST include visual architecture diagrams showing system components, data flow, and component relationships
- **FR-004**: Documentation MUST be structured for different audiences (architects, developers, stakeholders) with appropriate detail levels
- **FR-005**: Documentation MUST include security considerations, performance optimization strategies, and deployment guidelines
- **FR-006**: Documentation MUST provide testing strategies and quality assurance procedures
- **FR-007**: Documentation MUST include troubleshooting guides and common issues resolution
- **FR-008**: Documentation MUST be maintainable and version-controlled alongside code changes

### Key Entities

- **Technical Plan**: Comprehensive architecture document covering technology choices, design decisions, and integration patterns
- **Implementation Guide**: Step-by-step development documentation with code examples and configuration instructions
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Visual representations of system structure, data flow, and component interactions
- **Documentation Index**: Centralized navigation and organization of all interface layer documentation

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Technical architects can understand the interface layer architecture and make design decisions within 30 minutes of reviewing the documentation
- **SC-002**: Developers can implement a working interface layer component following the implementation guide within 2 hours
- **SC-003**: New team members can understand the system architecture and component relationships within 1 hour of studying the visual documentation
- **SC-004**: Documentation covers 100% of the interface layer components and integration points
- **SC-005**: Documentation is structured for 3 distinct audiences (architects, developers, stakeholders) with appropriate detail levels for each
- **SC-006**: Documentation includes security, performance, and deployment considerations for production readiness
- **SC-007**: Documentation provides clear testing strategies and quality assurance procedures
- **SC-008**: Documentation is maintainable and can be updated alongside code changes without breaking references or examples
