# Feature Specification: Caching Module Refactor

**Feature Branch**: `caching-refactor`  
**Created**: 2025-01-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "根据上述讨论内容制定重构规范，保持现有功能不变"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Simplify Infrastructure Module Architecture (Priority: P1)

As a developer using the caching module, I want a simpler, more direct API that follows infrastructure module best practices, so that I can easily integrate caching without dealing with complex DDD abstractions.

**Why this priority**: Infrastructure modules should be simple and direct, not complex domain models. The current DDD design is over-engineered for a caching utility.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that all existing caching functionality works with a simplified API that removes DDD complexity while maintaining the same core features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an existing application using the caching module, **When** the module is refactored to remove DDD complexity, **Then** all existing functionality continues to work without code changes
2. **Given** a developer wants to use caching, **When** they integrate the simplified module, **Then** they can do so with simple, direct API calls instead of complex value objects
3. **Given** the refactored caching module, **When** developers use it, **Then** they get the same multi-level isolation features with simpler implementation

### User Story 2 - Maintain Multi-Level Isolation (Priority: P1)

As a developer building multi-tenant applications, I want the caching module to continue providing automatic multi-level isolation (platform/tenant/organization/department/user), so that my application data remains properly isolated.

**Why this priority**: Multi-level isolation is a core business requirement that must be preserved during refactoring.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that cache keys are automatically generated with proper isolation context without requiring complex value object creation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a request with tenant context, **When** caching operations are performed, **Then** cache keys automatically include tenant isolation
2. **Given** a request with organization context, **When** caching operations are performed, **Then** cache keys automatically include organization isolation
3. **Given** different isolation contexts, **When** cache operations are performed, **Then** data remains properly isolated between contexts

---

### User Story 3 - Preserve Performance Monitoring (Priority: P2)

As a system administrator, I want to continue monitoring cache performance (hit rates, latency, errors), so that I can ensure optimal system performance.

**Why this priority**: Performance monitoring is important for production systems but secondary to core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that performance metrics are still collected and accessible through a simplified interface.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** cache operations are performed, **When** metrics are requested, **Then** hit rates, latency, and error counts are available
2. **Given** performance monitoring is enabled, **When** cache operations occur, **Then** metrics are automatically collected without complex domain event handling

---

### User Story 4 - Simplify Decorator Usage (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I want to use caching decorators (@Cacheable, @CacheEvict, @CachePut) with the same simplicity, so that I can continue using declarative caching without learning new complex APIs.

**Why this priority**: Decorators provide excellent developer experience and should be preserved with simplified implementation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that existing decorator usage continues to work with the same syntax and behavior.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a method with @Cacheable decorator, **When** the method is called, **Then** caching works as expected with simplified internal implementation
2. **Given** existing decorator configurations, **When** the module is refactored, **Then** no changes are required to decorator usage

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when isolation context is missing or incomplete?
- How does the system handle Redis connection failures with simplified error handling?
- What happens when cache keys exceed length limits with simplified validation?
- How does the system handle serialization errors with simplified error handling?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide the same caching API (get, set, del, exists, clear) with simplified implementation
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain automatic multi-level isolation without requiring complex value object creation
- **FR-003**: System MUST preserve all existing decorator functionality (@Cacheable, @CacheEvict, @CachePut)
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain performance monitoring capabilities with simplified metrics collection
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve Redis connection management and health checking
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain serialization/deserialization functionality with simplified error handling
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve batch operations (clear by pattern) with simplified implementation
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain TTL management with simplified configuration
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve all existing configuration options (sync/async configuration)
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility - no breaking changes to public API

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **CacheService**: Simplified service providing core caching operations without DDD complexity
- **RedisService**: Connection management service with simplified health checking
- **CacheMetricsService**: Performance monitoring service with simplified metrics collection
- **CacheConfig**: Configuration object for Redis and caching options

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: All existing caching functionality works without code changes after refactoring
- **SC-002**: Multi-level isolation continues to work automatically for all 5 isolation levels
- **SC-003**: Performance monitoring provides the same metrics with simplified collection
- **SC-004**: Decorator usage requires no changes to existing code
- **SC-005**: Module complexity is reduced by at least 50% (measured by lines of code and cyclomatic complexity)
- **SC-006**: Developer onboarding time is reduced by at least 30% for new team members
- **SC-007**: All existing tests pass without modification
- **SC-008**: Redis connection and error handling maintains the same reliability
- **SC-009**: Serialization/deserialization maintains the same functionality with simplified error handling
- **SC-010**: Configuration options remain the same with simplified internal implementation

## Assumptions

- Existing applications using the caching module will not need code changes
- Multi-level isolation is a core requirement that must be preserved
- Performance monitoring is important but can be simplified
- Redis connection management must remain robust
- Decorator pattern provides good developer experience and should be preserved
- Infrastructure modules should prioritize simplicity over complex domain modeling
- Backward compatibility is essential for existing applications
- The refactoring should focus on internal implementation, not public API changes
