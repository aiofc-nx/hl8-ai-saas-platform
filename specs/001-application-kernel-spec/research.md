# Research: Application Kernel Development Standards

**Date**: 2024-12-19  
**Feature**: Application Kernel Development Standards  
**Phase**: 0 - Research and Analysis

## Research Tasks

### Task 1: CQRS Pattern Implementation Research

**Context**: Need to design BaseCommand, BaseQuery, CommandHandler, and QueryHandler interfaces that provide consistent CQRS patterns for business modules.

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive CQRS base classes with rich interfaces

**Rationale**:

- BaseCommand and BaseQuery use EntityId from domain-kernel for consistent ID management
- Use IsolationContext from domain-kernel for multi-tenant isolation support
- CommandHandler and QueryHandler interfaces include validation, execution, error handling, and priority management
- Follows established CQRS patterns from backup/application analysis
- Aligns with domain-kernel design for consistent value object usage
- Supports framework-agnostic design

**Alternatives considered**:

- Simple command/query classes without rich interfaces → Rejected: insufficient for complex business scenarios
- Framework-specific implementations → Rejected: violates framework-agnostic requirement

### Task 2: Use Case Architecture Research

**Context**: Need to design BaseUseCase and BaseCommandUseCase abstract classes for business logic encapsulation.

**Decision**: Implement layered use case architecture with transaction and event management

**Rationale**:

- BaseUseCase provides common lifecycle management and validation
- BaseCommandUseCase extends with transaction management and event publishing
- Supports Clean Architecture principles
- Enables consistent business logic patterns

**Alternatives considered**:

- Single use case base class → Rejected: insufficient separation between query and command use cases
- Framework-specific use case patterns → Rejected: violates framework-agnostic requirement

### Task 3: Context Management Research

**Context**: Need to design IsolationContext and IUseCaseContext interfaces for multi-tenant isolation and context management.

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive context management with multi-level isolation support

**Rationale**:

- Use IsolationContext entity from domain-kernel for consistent multi-level isolation
- IUseCaseContext provides execution context for use cases
- Aligns with constitution's data isolation principles and domain-kernel design
- Supports shared/non-shared data classification through domain-kernel's IsolationContext
- Leverages domain-kernel's value objects (TenantId, OrganizationId, DepartmentId, UserId)

**Alternatives considered**:

- Simple tenant-only context → Rejected: insufficient for complex multi-tenant scenarios
- Framework-specific context management → Rejected: violates framework-agnostic requirement

### Task 4: Event-Driven Architecture Research

**Context**: Need to design DomainEvent interface and IEventBus interface for event-driven patterns.

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive event system with domain event structure and event bus interface

**Rationale**:

- DomainEvent interface aligns with domain-kernel's AggregateRoot event structure
- Uses EntityId from domain-kernel for consistent ID management
- IEventBus interface supports publish/subscribe patterns
- Enables event sourcing and event-driven architecture
- Supports loose coupling between components
- Integrates with domain-kernel's event system

**Alternatives considered**:

- Simple event objects without structure → Rejected: insufficient for complex event scenarios
- Framework-specific event systems → Rejected: violates framework-agnostic requirement

### Task 5: Transaction Management Research

**Context**: Need to design ITransactionManager interface for consistent transaction management.

**Decision**: Implement transaction management interface with lifecycle methods

**Rationale**:

- ITransactionManager provides begin, commit, rollback, isActive methods
- Supports consistent transaction boundaries across business modules
- Enables proper error handling and rollback scenarios
- Framework-agnostic design allows different implementations

**Alternatives considered**:

- Framework-specific transaction management → Rejected: violates framework-agnostic requirement
- No transaction management → Rejected: insufficient for data consistency requirements

### Task 6: Framework-Agnostic Design Research

**Context**: Need to ensure application kernel is framework-agnostic and doesn't depend on specific frameworks.

**Decision**: Use pure TypeScript interfaces and abstract classes without framework dependencies

**Rationale**:

- Pure TypeScript ensures maximum compatibility
- No external framework dependencies
- Business modules can use any framework (NestJS, Express, etc.)
- Maintains clean separation of concerns

**Alternatives considered**:

- Framework-specific implementations → Rejected: violates framework-agnostic requirement
- Mixed approach with optional framework support → Rejected: adds unnecessary complexity

### Task 7: Multi-Tenant Isolation Research

**Context**: Need to support multi-tenant isolation as per constitution requirements.

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive isolation context with support for all isolation levels

**Rationale**:

- Supports platform/tenant/organization/department/user level isolation
- Aligns with constitution's data isolation principles
- Enables fine-grained access control
- Supports both shared and non-shared data scenarios

**Alternatives considered**:

- Simple tenant-only isolation → Rejected: insufficient for complex enterprise scenarios
- No isolation support → Rejected: violates constitution requirements

## Research Summary

All research tasks have been completed with clear decisions and rationale. The application kernel will provide:

1. **CQRS Infrastructure**: BaseCommand, BaseQuery, CommandHandler, QueryHandler (aligned with domain-kernel)
2. **Use Case Architecture**: BaseUseCase, BaseCommandUseCase
3. **Context Management**: Uses IsolationContext from domain-kernel, IUseCaseContext
4. **Event System**: DomainEvent (aligned with domain-kernel AggregateRoot), IEventBus
5. **Transaction Management**: ITransactionManager
6. **Framework-Agnostic Design**: Pure TypeScript interfaces
7. **Multi-Tenant Support**: Leverages domain-kernel's IsolationContext and value objects
8. **Domain-Kernel Integration**: Consistent use of EntityId, IsolationContext, and other domain-kernel components

All decisions align with the constitution requirements and domain-kernel design, ensuring seamless integration between application and domain layers while supporting the goal of providing unified application layer development patterns for business modules.
