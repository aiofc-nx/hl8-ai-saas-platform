# Feature Specification: Application Kernel Development Standards

**Feature Branch**: `001-application-kernel-spec`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "根据上述讨论内容制定libs/application-kernel的开发规范"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Business Module Developer Uses Application Kernel (Priority: P1)

As a business module developer, I need to use the application kernel to implement consistent CQRS patterns and application layer architecture, so that I can focus on business logic without reinventing common infrastructure patterns.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - providing reusable foundation components for all business modules

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a sample business module that extends the application kernel base classes and demonstrates CQRS command/query handling

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a business module developer, **When** they import application kernel components, **Then** they can extend BaseCommand and BaseQuery classes for their domain
2. **Given** a business module developer, **When** they implement CommandHandler interface, **Then** they can handle domain commands with consistent patterns
3. **Given** a business module developer, **When** they implement QueryHandler interface, **Then** they can handle domain queries with consistent patterns

---

### User Story 2 - Application Layer Consistency (Priority: P1)

As a platform architect, I need all business modules to follow consistent application layer patterns, so that the codebase maintains architectural consistency and reduces cognitive load for developers.

**Why this priority**: Ensures architectural consistency across the entire platform

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that multiple business modules use the same base classes and interfaces from application kernel

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple business modules, **When** they implement application layer components, **Then** they all extend the same base classes from application kernel
2. **Given** a new business module, **When** it follows application kernel patterns, **Then** it integrates seamlessly with existing modules

---

### User Story 3 - Context Management and Isolation (Priority: P2)

As a multi-tenant platform, I need consistent context management across all business modules, so that tenant isolation and user context are properly maintained throughout the application layer.

**Why this priority**: Critical for multi-tenant architecture and security

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that all business modules use the same context management interfaces and maintain proper tenant isolation

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a multi-tenant request, **When** it flows through business modules, **Then** tenant context is consistently maintained
2. **Given** a user request, **When** it processes through application layer, **Then** user context and permissions are properly tracked

---

### User Story 4 - Event-Driven Architecture Support (Priority: P2)

As a business module developer, I need to publish and handle domain events consistently, so that I can implement event-driven patterns without managing event infrastructure.

**Why this priority**: Enables event-driven architecture patterns across the platform

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that business modules can publish domain events and handle them through consistent interfaces

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a business module, **When** it publishes domain events, **Then** events are handled through consistent event bus interfaces
2. **Given** a business module, **When** it handles domain events, **Then** it uses consistent event handler patterns

---

### User Story 5 - Transaction Management (Priority: P3)

As a business module developer, I need consistent transaction management across my application layer, so that data consistency is maintained without managing transaction boundaries manually.

**Why this priority**: Ensures data consistency and reduces boilerplate code

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that business modules can execute operations within transactions using consistent transaction management interfaces

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a business module, **When** it executes operations, **Then** it can use consistent transaction management interfaces
2. **Given** a failed operation, **When** it occurs within a transaction, **Then** the transaction is properly rolled back

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a business module doesn't follow the application kernel patterns?
- How does the system handle context management when tenant information is missing?
- What happens when event publishing fails during command execution?
- How does the system handle transaction rollback when multiple business modules are involved?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Application kernel MUST provide BaseCommand and BaseQuery abstract classes for business modules to extend
- **FR-002**: Application kernel MUST provide CommandHandler and QueryHandler interfaces for consistent command/query processing
- **FR-003**: Application kernel MUST provide BaseUseCase and BaseCommandUseCase abstract classes for business logic encapsulation
- **FR-004**: Application kernel MUST provide IsolationContext and IUseCaseContext interfaces for consistent context management
- **FR-005**: Application kernel MUST provide IEventBus interface for domain event publishing and handling
- **FR-006**: Application kernel MUST provide ITransactionManager interface for consistent transaction management
- **FR-007**: Application kernel MUST provide DomainEvent interface for consistent event structure
- **FR-008**: Application kernel MUST NOT include specific business domain implementations (user, tenant, organization, etc.)
- **FR-009**: Application kernel MUST be framework-agnostic and not depend on specific frameworks like NestJS
- **FR-010**: Application kernel MUST provide clear documentation and examples for business module developers

### Key Entities

- **BaseCommand**: Abstract base class for all domain commands with common properties (commandId, timestamp, tenantId, userId, metadata)
- **BaseQuery**: Abstract base class for all domain queries with common properties (queryId, timestamp, tenantId, userId, metadata)
- **CommandHandler**: Interface for handling domain commands with methods for validation, execution, and error handling
- **QueryHandler**: Interface for handling domain queries with methods for validation, execution, and result formatting
- **BaseUseCase**: Abstract base class for all business use cases with common lifecycle management
- **BaseCommandUseCase**: Abstract base class for command use cases with transaction and event management
- **IsolationContext**: Interface for tenant and user context management
- **IUseCaseContext**: Interface for use case execution context
- **DomainEvent**: Interface for domain events with standard properties
- **IEventBus**: Interface for event publishing and subscription
- **ITransactionManager**: Interface for transaction lifecycle management
