## Key Features of New Tasks

### Phase 6: Infrastructure Kernel Alignment

1. **MikroORM Entities** (T086-T091)
   - Create database entities for all domain aggregates/entities
   - Proper MikroORM decorators and relationships
   - Multi-tenant isolation fields

2. **Entity Mappers** (T092-T097)
   - Bidirectional mapping between domain and infrastructure
   - Value object unpacking and packing
   - Audit field handling

3. **Repository Updates** (T098-T105)
   - Extend AggregateRepositoryAdapter from infrastructure-kernel
   - Use IDatabaseAdapter and ICacheService
   - Proper isolation context handling

### Phase 7: Application Kernel Alignment

1. **Command Alignment** (T106-T110)
   - All commands extend BaseCommand
   - IsolationContext integration
   - Proper command structure

2. **Query Alignment** (T111-T114)
   - All queries extend BaseQuery
   - IsolationContext integration
   - Proper query structure

3. **Handler Alignment** (T115-T120)
   - Implement CommandHandler and QueryHandler interfaces
   - Proper execute() method signatures
   - Context handling

4. **Use Case Alignment** (T121-T128)
   - All use cases extend BaseUseCase
   - IUseCaseContext integration
   - Proper use case lifecycle

## Dependencies Updated

### Phase Completion Order

1. ‚úÖ Phase 1-3: Domain Layer Enhancements
2. üîÑ Phase 4: Domain Integration
3. ‚è∏Ô∏è Phase 5: Testing (can run in parallel with 6-7)
4. ‚è∏Ô∏è Phase 6: Infrastructure Kernel Alignment
5. ‚è∏Ô∏è Phase 7: Application Kernel Alignment

### Critical Dependencies

- Phase 6 depends on Phase 4 completion
- Phase 7 depends on Phase 6 completion
- Phase 5 can run in parallel with Phases 6-7

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Phase 4**: Finish remaining 8 tasks (T054-T059)
2. **Start Phase 6**: Infrastructure kernel alignment
3. **Start Phase 7**: Application kernel alignment
4. **Parallel Phase 5**: Testing can be done alongside 6-7

## Implementation Guide

All new tasks follow the established task format:

- `- [ ] T0XX [P?] [US?] Description with file path`

Tasks marked with `[P]` can be executed in parallel.  
Tasks are organized by phase and include clear file paths.
