# Research Findings: SAAS Core Module with CASL Permission System

**Date**: 2024-12-19  
**Feature**: SAAS Core Module Specification Documentation  
**Phase**: Phase 0 - Research and Analysis

## Research Overview

This research phase focused on analyzing the existing architecture documentation, business requirements, and domain terminology to create comprehensive technical documentation for the SAAS Core module with integrated CASL (Code Access Security Library) permission system. The research covered multi-tenant architecture patterns, Clean Architecture implementation, DDD principles, event-driven architecture, CASL integration strategies, and leveraging existing domain-kernel infrastructure.

## Key Research Areas

### 1. CASL Permission System Integration

**Decision**: Integrate CASL (Code Access Security Library) for sophisticated permission and authorization management

**Rationale**:

- CASL provides a powerful, flexible, and type-safe authorization library for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Excellent support for complex permission scenarios including role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- Strong TypeScript integration with type-safe ability definitions
- Supports both frontend and backend authorization scenarios
- Provides excellent performance with <50ms permission checks
- Seamless integration with NestJS and existing Clean Architecture patterns

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Custom permission system: Would require significant development effort and maintenance overhead
- RBAC-only libraries: Too limited for complex multi-tenant scenarios
- Policy-based systems: More complex to implement and maintain than CASL
- Database-driven permissions: Performance issues and complexity in multi-tenant scenarios

### 2. Multi-Tenant Architecture Patterns

**Decision**: ROW_LEVEL_SECURITY as default strategy with future scalability to SCHEMA_PER_TENANT and DATABASE_PER_TENANT

**Rationale**:

- ROW_LEVEL_SECURITY provides the best balance of security, performance, and operational simplicity for the initial implementation
- PostgreSQL RLS (Row Level Security) provides database-level isolation without application complexity
- Future migration paths are well-defined for enterprise customers requiring higher isolation levels
- CASL integration works seamlessly with RLS through tenant context

**Alternatives Considered**:

- SCHEMA_PER_TENANT: More complex to manage, requires dynamic schema creation
- DATABASE_PER_TENANT: Highest isolation but significant operational overhead
- Shared database with application-level filtering: Security risks and performance issues

### 3. Clean Architecture Layer Design with CASL Integration

**Decision**: Four-layer architecture (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Interface) with CASL integrated across all layers

**Rationale**:

- Domain layer contains CASL ability definitions and permission business logic
- Application layer implements CASL-based permission checks and authorization use cases
- Infrastructure layer provides CASL persistence and caching mechanisms
- Interface layer uses CASL guards for request authorization
- Clean separation of concerns while maintaining CASL integration throughout

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Three-layer architecture: Insufficient separation of concerns for complex SAAS platform
- Hexagonal architecture: Similar benefits but Clean Architecture is more widely adopted
- Microservices architecture: Too complex for initial implementation, can be evolved later

### 4. Domain-Driven Design Implementation with CASL

**Decision**: Rich domain models with aggregates, value objects, and domain services integrated with CASL abilities

**Rationale**:

- Rich domain models encapsulate business logic and permission rules within entities
- Aggregates ensure consistency boundaries and business invariants including permission constraints
- Value objects provide type safety and validation for permission-related concepts
- Domain services handle cross-entity business logic and CASL ability management
- CASL abilities are defined as domain concepts and managed through domain services

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Anemic domain models: Violates DDD principles and leads to procedural code
- Transaction script pattern: Insufficient for complex business logic and permissions
- Active record pattern: Tightly couples domain logic with persistence concerns

### 5. CQRS and Event Sourcing Patterns with CASL

**Decision**: Command-Query Responsibility Segregation with Event Sourcing for audit trails and state reconstruction, integrated with CASL permission events

**Rationale**:

- CQRS allows independent optimization of read and write models
- Event Sourcing provides complete audit trails and supports time travel
- Event-driven architecture enables loose coupling between components
- CASL permission changes are recorded as domain events for complete audit trails
- Supports complex business workflows and integration scenarios with permission tracking

**Alternatives Considered**:

- CRUD operations only: Insufficient for complex business workflows and permission management
- Event sourcing without CQRS: Read model optimization challenges
- CQRS without event sourcing: Limited audit capabilities for permission changes

### 6. Data Isolation Strategy with CASL Context

**Decision**: 5-tier data isolation (Platform/Tenant/Organization/Department/User) with RLS implementation and CASL context integration

**Rationale**:

- Supports complex organizational structures and permission hierarchies
- Provides granular access control for different data types
- Enables flexible sharing policies within organizational boundaries
- Supports user multi-organization membership scenarios
- CASL abilities are context-aware and respect isolation boundaries
- Permission checks automatically consider isolation context

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Simple tenant-level isolation: Insufficient for enterprise requirements
- User-level isolation only: Too granular for organizational management
- Custom isolation levels: Too complex and non-standard

### 7. Technology Stack Decisions with CASL

**Decision**: TypeScript 5.9.2, Node.js >= 20, NestJS, PostgreSQL, MikroORM, Redis, CASL

**Rationale**:

- TypeScript provides strong typing and better developer experience
- NestJS offers excellent support for Clean Architecture and DDD patterns
- PostgreSQL provides robust RLS support and ACID compliance
- MikroORM offers good TypeScript integration and DDD support
- Redis provides high-performance caching and session management
- CASL provides sophisticated permission management with excellent TypeScript support

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Java/Spring Boot: More complex setup and deployment
- Python/Django: Less type safety and performance
- MongoDB: No native RLS support, eventual consistency issues
- TypeORM: Less DDD support compared to MikroORM
- Custom permission system: Significant development and maintenance overhead

### 8. Testing Strategy with CASL

**Decision**: Comprehensive testing approach with unit, integration, and e2e tests including CASL permission testing

**Rationale**:

- Unit tests ensure domain logic correctness and business rule validation
- Integration tests verify layer interactions and external dependencies
- E2E tests validate complete user workflows and system behavior
- CASL-specific tests ensure permission logic correctness and performance
- Test coverage requirements ensure quality and maintainability

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Unit tests only: Insufficient coverage of integration scenarios
- E2E tests only: Slow feedback and difficult debugging
- Manual testing only: Unreliable and not scalable

### 9. Documentation Approach with CASL

**Decision**: Comprehensive technical documentation with Chinese language support and CASL integration guides

**Rationale**:

- Chinese documentation aligns with project requirements and team preferences
- Comprehensive documentation ensures knowledge transfer and maintainability
- Technical documentation supports implementation and integration
- Business documentation ensures alignment with requirements
- CASL integration documentation provides clear guidance for permission system implementation

**Alternatives Considered**:

- English-only documentation: Doesn't align with project requirements
- Minimal documentation: Insufficient for complex SAAS platform
- Documentation after implementation: Leads to outdated and incomplete docs
