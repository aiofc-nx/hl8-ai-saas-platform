# Tasks: SAAS Core Module Specification Documentation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-spec-documentation/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Documentation creation tasks - no traditional tests, but documentation validation is required

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent documentation creation and validation of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different sections, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Documentation**: `specs/005-spec-documentation/` directory
- All documentation files are markdown (.md) files
- API contracts in `specs/005-spec-documentation/contracts/` directory

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-12)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
  - P1 stories (US1-US4) should be completed first
  - P2 stories (US5-US7) depend on P1 completion
  - P3 stories (US8-US10) depend on P2 completion
- **Polish (Phase 13)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Multi-tenant architecture - Foundation for all other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Tenant lifecycle - Can start after US1
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Organization structure - Can start after US1
- **User Story 4 (P1)**: Permissions - Can start after US1 and US3
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Business rules - Can start after US1 and US2
- **User Story 6 (P2)**: API documentation - Can start after US1-US4
- **User Story 7 (P2)**: Events - Can start after US1-US4
- **User Story 8 (P3)**: Data model - Can start after US1-US4 (already partially covered in Phase 2)
- **User Story 9 (P3)**: Testing - Can start after all implementation stories
- **User Story 10 (P3)**: Deployment - Can start after all implementation stories

### Parallel Opportunities

- Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Within each user story, tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members after foundational phase

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1-4 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3-6: User Stories 1-4 (P1 priorities)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Review MVP documentation
5. Present MVP to stakeholders

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Stories 1-4 (P1) ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Present (MVP!)
3. Add User Stories 5-7 (P2) ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Present
4. Add User Stories 8-10 (P3) ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Present
5. Polish and finalize all documentation

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Stories 1-2
   - Developer B: User Stories 3-4
   - Developer C: User Stories 5-7
3. All documentation integrates into unified documentation set

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different sections/files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story documentation should be independently reviewable
- All documentation must follow TSDoc standards for code references
- All documentation must be in Chinese as per project requirements
- Validate documentation against business requirements after each phase
- Stop at any checkpoint to review and validate documentation independently
