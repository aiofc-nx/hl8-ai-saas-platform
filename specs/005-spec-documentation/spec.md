2. **Given** the need for ROW_LEVEL_SECURITY as default strategy, **When** I document the isolation implementation, **Then** it should specify how all tenants use unified row-level isolation with tenant_id filtering
3. **Given** the requirement for future scalability, **When** I document the architecture, **Then** it should include plans for SCHEMA_PER_TENANT and DATABASE_PER_TENANT strategies for enterprise customers
