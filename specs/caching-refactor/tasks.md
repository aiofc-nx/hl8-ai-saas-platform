# Tasks: Caching Module Refactor

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/caching-refactor/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are included to ensure refactoring maintains functionality while simplifying implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Project**: `libs/caching/` at repository root
- **Source**: `libs/caching/src/`
- **Tests**: Unit tests co-located with source files (`.spec.ts`)
- **Integration tests**: `libs/caching/src/__tests__/integration/`

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and backup current implementation

- [ ] T001 Create backup of current caching module in libs/caching-backup/
- [ ] T002 [P] Analyze current codebase complexity metrics in libs/caching/src/
- [ ] T003 [P] Document current API surface in libs/caching/docs/current-api.md
- [ ] T004 Setup refactoring branch and development environment

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T005 Create simplified error classes in libs/caching/src/exceptions/simplified-errors.ts
- [ ] T006 [P] Create utility functions for key generation in libs/caching/src/utils/key-generator.util.ts

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 completion for isolation context
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 completion for metrics integration
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 completion for decorator functionality

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Core service refactoring before decorator updates
- Service implementation before integration testing
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, User Stories 1 and 2 can start in parallel
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Documentation tasks in Polish phase marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for simplified CacheService in libs/caching/src/services/cache.service.spec.ts"
Task: "Unit test for simplified RedisService in libs/caching/src/services/redis.service.spec.ts"
Task: "Integration test for basic caching operations in libs/caching/src/__tests__/integration/cache-operations.spec.ts"
Task: "Integration test for decorator functionality in libs/caching/src/__tests__/integration/decorator-operations.spec.ts"

# Launch core refactoring tasks together:
Task: "Refactor CacheService to remove DDD complexity in libs/caching/src/services/cache.service.ts"
Task: "Simplify RedisService error handling in libs/caching/src/services/redis.service.ts"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Core refactoring)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Isolation) - can start after US1
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Metrics) - can start after US1
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Decorators) - can start after US1
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- Focus on maintaining 100% backward compatibility throughout refactoring
- Measure complexity reduction and performance improvements at each checkpoint
