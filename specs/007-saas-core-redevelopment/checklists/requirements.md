## Notes

- All checklist items pass validation
- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- The redevelopment approach addresses the core architectural issues identified in the current saas-core implementation
- The specification builds upon the existing documentation from specs/005-spec-documentation while focusing on the redevelopment aspects
- The specification now fully complies with the architecture requirements defined in docs/architecture
- All requirements properly reference @hl8 kernel components and follow the hybrid architecture pattern
- **Key Architecture Improvements**: The specification now includes critical requirements learned from specs/005-spec-documentation/architecture to avoid previous development errors:
  - 5-layer multi-tenant isolation architecture (Platform → Tenant → Organization → Department → User)
  - Progressive database strategy selection (RLS → SCHEMA_PER_TENANT → DATABASE_PER_TENANT)
  - Strict permission hierarchy with proper inheritance
  - Department hierarchy supporting up to 7 levels with path tracking
  - Organization sharing mechanisms for private and shared organizations
  - User assignment rules ensuring single department per organization
  - Platform-level data isolation with complete separation from tenant data
- **Business Requirements Compliance**: The specification now fully complies with .cursor/docs/definition-of-terms.mdc and .cursor/docs/saas-core-business-requirements.mdc:
  - Tenant type management supporting all 5 types (FREE, BASIC, PROFESSIONAL, ENTERPRISE, CUSTOM) with proper resource limits
  - Tenant lifecycle management supporting all state transitions with proper business rules
  - Organization types supporting all 4 types (Committee, ProjectTeam, QualityGroup, PerformanceGroup) with horizontal management
  - Department hierarchy supporting up to 7 levels with vertical management structure
  - User classification system supporting platform users, tenant users, system users with proper role hierarchy
  - Tenant creation workflow allowing platform users to apply for tenant creation with proper validation
  - Resource monitoring and alerting system with proper escalation and upgrade recommendations
  - Audit logging system with complete traceability and compliance support
- **Configuration and Structure Compliance**: The specification now includes requirements for preserving existing directory structure and following global configuration standardization:
  - Preservation of existing libs/saas-core directory structure (src/domain, src/application, src/infrastructure, src/interface)
  - Compliance with global configuration standardization patterns as defined in .cursor/docs/global-configuration-standardization.md
  - Proper package.json structure with workspace dependencies and standardized scripts
  - Alignment of ESLint, TypeScript, and Jest configurations with global standards
- **Subdomain Structure Preservation**: The specification now includes requirements for preserving existing subdomain structure and organization:
  - Preservation of existing subdomain structure within each Clean Architecture layer (domain/aggregates, domain/entities, domain/value-objects, application/commands, application/queries, application/use-cases, infrastructure/repositories, infrastructure/casl, infrastructure/cache, interface/controllers, interface/dto, interface/guards)
  - Maintenance of database subdomain separation (infrastructure/repositories/postgresql, infrastructure/repositories/mongodb) for multi-database support
  - Preservation of infrastructure subdomain organization (casl, cache, database, entities, mappers, repositories, services) for proper separation of concerns
- **Kernel Component Prioritization**: The specification now emphasizes the critical importance of using @hl8 kernel components as the foundation for saas-core business module development:
  - Prioritization of @hl8 kernel components as the foundation for saas-core business module development, leveraging generic base components from each layer
  - Utilization of @hl8/domain-kernel base classes (BaseEntity, AggregateRoot, BaseValueObject, EntityId) for all domain objects instead of custom implementations
  - Utilization of @hl8/application-kernel components (BaseUseCase, BaseCommand, BaseQuery, CommandHandler, QueryHandler) for all application layer operations instead of custom implementations
  - Utilization of @hl8/infrastructure-kernel components for all infrastructure layer implementations instead of custom infrastructure code
  - Utilization of @hl8/interface-kernel components (RestController, AuthenticationGuard, AuthorizationGuard) for all interface layer implementations instead of custom implementations
  - Utilization of @hl8 cross-cutting concern components (@hl8/exceptions, @hl8/caching, @hl8/config, @hl8/nestjs-fastify) for all cross-cutting concerns instead of custom implementations
- **Data Isolation Requirements**: The specification now emphasizes the critical importance of using @hl8/domain-kernel isolation components for all data isolation requirements:
  - Utilization of @hl8/domain-kernel isolation components (IsolationContext, IsolationLevel, SharingLevel, DataAccessContext) for all data isolation requirements instead of custom isolation implementations
  - Implementation of data isolation using IsolationContext.buildWhereClause() for all database queries to ensure proper tenant/organization/department/user level filtering
  - Implementation of cache isolation using IsolationContext.buildCacheKey() for all cache operations to ensure proper data separation across isolation levels
  - Implementation of access control using IsolationContext.canAccess() for all data access operations to ensure proper permission validation
